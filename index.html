                    <p><b>Who am I?</b> This is a good question that I have no good way of answering. I don't know. I think of myself as someone who thinks globally - I've held three different passports in my life, I was born in Germany, 
                        and in the last 19 or so years I've been in 20 countries. I care quite a lot about the environment. I think it's pretty neat.. some of my favorite things to do are mountain biking and hiking (you would be surprised
                        at how many times I have come close to dying on a glacier,) and I have worked on some cool projects that might help a little - one manageing the risks of climate change in cities with AI, and one developing sustainable nano coatings for plastics 
                        (it tourns out that the problem with recycling is rarely the substrate but rather the microscopic layers on top of it.) Other than that I love technology, I always build my computers, and I love learning about tech. This also means 
                        that I have a pretty broad set of skills when it comes to the kind of thing... (Remember that while hireing ;) )
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p><b>What am I doing with my life?</b> Generally I have no clue but I say that I'm an engineering student at the University of Waterloo. Specifically Systems Design Engineering. This is my second year, I graduate in 2024.
                        The reason why I made this website, and probably why I applied to your job posting is because I'm looking for a co-op position for the spring/summer semester in 2021. The plan is that with every co-op I come a bit closer to 
                        figureing out what I'm doing...</p>
                        <br/>
                    <p><b>What's your favorite movie?</b> Probably Kill Bill, I watched it when I was wwaaaaay too young and I was both mildly traumatized and also highly inspired. This also happens to be how I feel about the Angular framework.</p>

                                Over the years I have developed significant skills in data science. I have worked with massive datasets on the order of 10s of millions, consumer data from accross Canada, and all sorts of other information. While most of this work 
                                has been done using python and it's libraries, there is also a portion based on data collection using Google's big Querry.

                                    I have worked with a variety of databases. My favorite is Neo4j (graph databases are pretty cool,) but I have also worked with SQL and MongoDB (unfortunately mainstream tech isn't as cool.) While I have expericence working and creating backend services with these dababases,
                                    my favorite task is creating really great datamodels - for fact I spent a tonne of time creating various datamodels built ground up for identity resolution at one of Canada's biggest companies.

                            to predict various statistics. I am incredibly excited to further my AI skills in the future.

                                    One of my hobbies for the last couple of years has been web development. I love trying out new technologies and I try to have fun with it. Some of my favorite technologies include Angular and Expres, although I have worked with Vue and React, as well as ASP.NET.
                                    Honestly I have a tendency to go with whatever I feel like in the moment... oh well, at least I'm usefull in a lot of different environment and generally know what's going on.

                            The most important thing in statistics, AI, Deep learning and datascience is data. Unfortunately it is also the most difficult part of all these fiels. I have experience in getting data from many sources, wether it is Google cloud, Google Streetview, 
                            or any other website or database that needs to be scraped, cleaned and prepared.
